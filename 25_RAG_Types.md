~10-12 RAG types cover 90% of real-world needs
Standard, Conversational, and Graph RAG are must-haves
Many variants are research explorations rather than production necessities
The complexity often isn't justified by performance gains
Industry tends to focus on robust implementation of fewer approaches rather than experimenting with all variants
Bottom line: While all 25 have academic merit, about 10-12 serve the majority of practical use cases effectively.
